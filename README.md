# Flappy-Bird
 
This project aims to enhance my skills in Unity C# programming, game mechanics, and mobile game development.

**Player Control:** Developed the player control script to handle bird movement and flapping. Tap to flap the bird's wings and navigate through obstacles.

**Obstacle Generation:** Randomly generated pipes with varying gaps.

**Collision Detection:** Implemented obstacle generation and collision detection mechanics. Game over on collision with pipes or ground.

**Score Display:** Real-time score tracking.

**Start and Game Over Screens:** Smooth transitions between game states

**2D Graphics:** Simple and clean sprites for the bird, pipes, and background.

**Animation:** Smooth bird flapping animation.
